FROM v5 TO v6
Decorators no longer support a string with comma separated identifiers, use *args instead, e.g.: @required('a, b') -> @required('a', 'b')
Most methods and properties now have the 'mc_' prefix?

RepeatableItems wil no longer calculate an automatic id if mc_key is specified as None
Use NumberedRepeatableItems instead TODO

Overriding the setattr or mc_select_envs methods no longer requires mc_caller_file_name and mc_caller_line_num, instead 'mc_error_info_up_level'
must be passed, use the uplevel value of 'setattr/mc_select_envs' + 1

The 'override' method has been replaced by a 'mc_force' parameter on the 'setattr' method
The '!' postfix for 'setattr' to overwrite a @property method has been replaced with a 'mc_overwrite_property' parameter
The '?' postfix for 'setattr' to set unknown attributes (attributes not defined in __init__) has been replaced with a 'mc_set_unknown' parameter

Json filter and fallback can only be specifed on mc_config and the same filter/fallback will be applied on all objects

None is not a special value any more! !!! In earlier versions of multiconf  None would be overriden with non-None values in mc_init. This is no longer the case. Use MC_REQUIRED to assign default values which MUST be overriden.
